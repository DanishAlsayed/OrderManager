Assumptions
The flow of callbacks for an order:
1- Request
2- Ack/Reject
3- Fill (if acked in (2) above)

Notes:
An order that has been acked cannot be rejected
An an amend cannot be entertained for an order that does not exist or has been fully filled
An amend is applied on the original order after it has been acked
Only the last amend is entertained i.e. if an amend is submitted for an order that already has an unacked amend the new amend will replace the existing unacked amend
Exceptions are thrown in case any of the callbacks fails to succeed in its intended operation
Part A corresponds to while Part B RequestRateListener corresponds to PositionsListener
I assumed Part A (RequestRateListener) and Part B (PositionsListener) are independent as the assessment description asked for implementing the Listener interface in each of parts A and B
I will send the .h and .cpp files via email as instructed (i.e. no .zip files)
For Part A, once the request rate exceeded the next request is not entertained until the rate falls below the threshold, I assume this was to prevent exchange spamming
No order can be amended down to have quantity 0
